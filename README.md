# Forms-CSS
Forms using Front-end web development languages like HTML and CSS
I have created this Form using HTML and CSS on 16 july 2019 in Signals and Systems India pvt ltd (SANDS) as a part of training.
I have had partial knowledge on display(none/block/inline/inline-block/...etc) and position(relative/absolute)
I have aimed to keep the page away from scrollbars... and kept it entirely static(resizing and increasing each div height could result in  enabling of scrollbars
